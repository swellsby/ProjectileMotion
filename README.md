# ProjectileMotion
This is a set of 4 files which allow a user to choose an initial velocity and launch angle as well as viewing axis in order to calculate the airtime, 
maximum height, and distance travelled based on those input values. An animation is also displayed below these calculated values which scales to 
an appropriate scale and displays the path of the projectile as viewed from the selected viewing axis.
